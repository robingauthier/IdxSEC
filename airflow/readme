How do you remove examples ???

airflow dags list
Error: Failed to load all files. For details, run `airflow dags list-import-errors`
********
this command is super useful and enables to debug ::
airflow dags list-import-errors
********


*****************
How do I test once it the DAG has been recognized ?
airflow dags test form14
---> you can put some debugging in the code but not in the dag definition
---> but if it crashed you cannot do %debug which is a shame
*****************


On the UI, you need to push every task to Paused=False because this is not the default
